Floyd-Warshall algorithm visualization on C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Just a piece of code visualising Floyd-Warshall algorithm of a graph you give to it. The look is customizable by tuning defines of FloydVisualizer.cpp.

This project was never intended to be something long-lasting or evolving, think of it as a "written-and-forgotten" app. Most probably I won't change anything here ever.
